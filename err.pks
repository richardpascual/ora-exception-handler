/**
 *
 * ERR Package Spec - An internal, universal database exception handling
 * utility
 *
 * Description:
 * This package tracks errors reported through Oracle exception handling.
 * Errors can be reported through console output (dbms_output), table-based
 * logs, or written out to an OS level text file. VERBOSE output is available
 * to report backtrace and stack errors through a separate logging table
 * named: ERRMORE.
 *
 * Implementation:
 * GRANT select privileges to the two tables: ERRLOG and ERRMORE
 * GRANT execute on ERR to the user/schema which calls this package and
 * its procedure/function objects.
 *
 * ora-exception-handler: a flexible package for Oracle PL/SQL exception handling
