# Oracle Exception Handler #

This started out as a quick project to assist with other Oracle-based PL/SQL programming projects. It is an adaptation of a PL/SQL package script originally written by Steven Feuerstein in a back-issue of O'Reilly's *Oracle PL/SQL Best Practices (First Edition)*. I have added some additional enhancements such as session id tracking, custom error message calls, application self identification.

Before you download from the **master** branch, make sure to check out the **expanded-error-stack** branch of the repository.  It contains the new changes destined for version 2.0.  There is a new table for stacktrace errors and also access to session information (DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO) for improved troubleshooting ability.  More details on how to use this new functionality is in the wiki. 

## Installation Notes ##

Log in to the schema you wish to implement this package. It is recommended NOT to install this in the SYS schema which is generally reserved for system and database management tasks. Instead, at the very least, create a user account which will serve as the home of this package and its supporting table. To use the install script ERR.sql as it is written, you will need to do the following:

#. Log in as the SYS user as the SYSDBA role.
    SQLPLUS /nolog
    connect sys/password as sysdba
#. Issue the following command before executing the scripts, substituting your schema/user name in place of the placeholder used below:
    ALTER SESSION SET CURRENT_SCHEMA = your-user-schema
#. Run the scripts in the following order: ERR.sql; ERR.pks (package spec); ERR.pkb (package body)

That's it.

## Implementation Guide ##

To implement the package, the easiest way is to use the default behavior, which sends all error output messages to the table. You also have the option to send error output selectively to DBMS_OUTPUT, or to a FILE. The example below is an exception block where you send the standard information to a table:

    EXCEPTION
        When OTHERS THEN
            ERR.HANDLE;
    END;

Note that all arguments are optional and that this package procedure call will work for almost every error situation dynamically. See the Wiki for further notes and recipes for the package calls so that you can understand what functionality is available.
